                    I graduated from college with a BS in mechanical engineering and took a job with GM/EDS.  After I logged a few years of progamming CAD/CAM systems, I requested a transfer to corporate training where I taught PL/I and DB2.  Though I enjoyed my work as a programmer, I found a greater passion in teaching.  I left the corportate world and became a high school math teacher.  After several years in the classroom, I once again find myself looking for a new challenge.  It only makes sense to return to the career that I once enjoyed so much that I wanted to teach it.

                    When I am not working, I like spending time with my wife and three boys at our cabin near Brainerd.  My boys enjoy playing hockey and mountain baking.  In the last few years, I have taken up both of those sports myself.
